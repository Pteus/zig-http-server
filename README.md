# HTTP Server â€“ Follow-Along from *Introduction to Zig*  

This repository contains my implementation of a **basic HTTP server**, built while following **Chapter 7 â€“ Project 2** of [*Introduction to Zig*](https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/) by Pedro Park.  

The goal of this project is to apply Zig concepts in a real-world setting, exploring networking, concurrency, and low-level I/O operations.

## ðŸ“– About Chapter 7 â€“ *Building an HTTP Server from Scratch*  

Chapter 7 of *Introduction to Zig* walks through the process of implementing a simple HTTP server from scratch.  
This project helps reinforce key Zig concepts such as:  

- **Handling TCP connections** using Zigâ€™s networking APIs  
- **Parsing HTTP requests** and generating valid responses  
- **Efficient memory management** with Zigâ€™s allocator system
